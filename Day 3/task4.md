## Task 4: Practice sorting and filtering text data using sort and uniq. 

The `sort` and `uniq` commands in Linux are powerful tools used for text processing. They are often used together to organize and analyze data in text files. Letâ€™s dive into each command, how they work, and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

### 1. `sort` Command

The `sort` command arranges the lines of a text file or input in a particular order. By default, it sorts the lines in alphabetical order, but it can also sort numerically, reverse the order, and much more.

#### Basic Syntax
```bash
sort [options] [file]
```

#### Common Options
- `-n`: Sorts the input numerically.
- `-r`: Reverses the sorting order.
- `-u`: Removes duplicates (this is a shorthand way to combine `sort` and `uniq`).
- `-k`: Sorts based on a specific key (field) in the line.
- `-t`: Specifies a delimiter to define fields.

#### Example 1: Sorting Alphabetically
```bash
cat fruits.txt
apple
banana
cherry
apple
banana
date

sort fruits.txt
```

**Output:**
```text
apple
apple
banana
banana
cherry
date
```

Here, `sort` arranges the lines in alphabetical order.

#### Example 2: Sorting Numerically
```bash
cat numbers.txt
3
10
1
20
2

sort -n numbers.txt
```

**Output:**
```text
1
2
3
10
20
```

The `-n` option tells `sort` to treat the lines as numbers and sort them accordingly.

#### Example 3: Reverse Sorting
```bash
sort -r fruits.txt
```

**Output:**
```text
date
cherry
banana
banana
apple
apple
```

The `-r` option reverses the order of the sorting.

#### Example 4: Sorting by a Specific Field
If you have a file where each line has multiple fields, separated by a space or another delimiter, you can sort by a specific field.

```bash
cat employees.txt
John 25 Developer
Alice 30 Manager
Bob 22 Intern
Eve 35 Director

sort -k 2n employees.txt
```

**Output:**
```text
Bob 22 Intern
John 25 Developer
Alice 30 Manager
Eve 35 Director
```

Here, `-k 2n` sorts by the second field (age), treating it as a number.

### 2. `uniq` Command

The `uniq` command filters out or identifies repeated lines in a sorted file. It only works on adjacent matching lines, so it's often used in combination with `sort`.

#### Basic Syntax
```bash
uniq [options] [file]
```

#### Common Options
- `-c`: Prefixes each output line with the number of occurrences.
- `-d`: Only prints duplicate lines.
- `-u`: Only prints unique lines.

#### Example 1: Removing Duplicates
```bash
sort fruits.txt | uniq
```

**Output:**
```text
apple
banana
cherry
date
```

Here, `sort` organizes the lines so that duplicates are adjacent, and `uniq` removes them.

#### Example 2: Counting Occurrences
```bash
sort fruits.txt | uniq -c
```

**Output:**
```text
      2 apple
      2 banana
      1 cherry
      1 date
```

The `-c` option shows the number of times each line appears in the file.

#### Example 3: Displaying Only Duplicates
```bash
sort fruits.txt | uniq -d
```

**Output:**
```text
apple
banana
```

The `-d` option makes `uniq` only display lines that are repeated.

### 3. Using `sort` and `uniq` Together

These commands are often used together to first sort the data, then remove duplicates or count occurrences.

#### Example: Finding and Counting Unique Lines
```bash
cat access.log
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.1

sort access.log | uniq -c
```

**Output:**
```text
      3 192.168.1.1
      2 192.168.1.2
      1 192.168.1.3
```

In this example:
- **`sort access.log`**: Sorts the IP addresses so that duplicates are adjacent.
- **`uniq -c`**: Counts how many times each IP address appears in the file.

### Summary

- **`sort`**: Organizes the lines of a file or input in a specific order (alphabetical, numerical, etc.).
- **`uniq`**: Removes or identifies duplicate lines in a sorted file.

By using these commands together, you can efficiently process text files, identify patterns, and summarize data.
